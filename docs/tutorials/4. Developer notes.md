# Developer notes

## Good practices
<!-- We recommend you to write your feature extraction process inside a WebWorker or as AudioWorklets. -->
- Imports in different contexts
- Memory
- Computing analysis off the UI thread to avoid blocking

## Offline feature extraction
e.g. offline melspectrogram demo?
- ### Web Workers 

## Real-time feature extraction

- ### Audio Worklets and Essentia.j

- ### Tensorflow.js
